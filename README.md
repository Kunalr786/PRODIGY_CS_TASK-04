First, install the "pynput" library by runnning the command pip install pynput.
This script listens for keyboard events and writes the corresponding characters to a file named "keystrokes.log". To run the keylogger, execute the following command:
python keylogger.py

The keylogger will run indefinitely until you manually stop it (e.g., by closing the terminal or pressing Ctrl+C).

Again, it's crucial to remember that using keyloggers without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have the necessary permissions before implementing or using a keylogger.
